## 📚 Core Business Rules

Trackventory follows strict architectural principles to ensure data integrity:

1. **🚫 NO STOCK FIELD** - Stock is always calculated from transactions (never stored)
2. **🔒 NO TRANSACTION DELETION** - All history is immutable and auditable
3. **⚛️ ATOMIC OPERATIONS** - All multi-step operations use database transactions
4. **🔁 IDEMPOTENCY** - Duplicate requests are prevented with unique IDs
5. **✅ NEVER TRUST FRONTEND** - All validations and business logic on backend
